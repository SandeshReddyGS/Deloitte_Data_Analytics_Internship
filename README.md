# Task - 1
Using a data unification algorithm, the tech team at our client, Daikibo, has converted all telemetry data collected from its 4 factories:
Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 mins. Daikibo has been collecting this data for one month (May 2021) and they've shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.
## The reason the client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:
* In which location did machines break the most?
* What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
